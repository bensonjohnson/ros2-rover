### 2. Map Management System ✅
- **Manual map naming** with validation
- **Interactive map selection** prompts
- **Map quality assessment** with recommendations
- **Storage in /home/ubuntu/maps** as requested

### 3. RTAB-Map Optimization ✅

## Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Basic System Startup
```bash
# Test the enhanced launcher
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh mapping
```

**Expected Results:**
- Interactive menu appears with map options
- Safety is enabled by default
- No GPS components launched
- Proper timing sequence for startup

### Test 2: New Map Creation
```bash
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh mapping
# Select 'n' for new map
# Enter map name: "test_indoor_map"
# Should launch with new map
```

**Expected Results:**
- Map name validation works
- Metadata file created in /home/ubuntu/maps/
- RTAB-Map starts with new database
- Safety monitor active

### Test 3: Map Resume
```bash
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh mapping
# Select existing map from list
# Should resume mapping
```

**Expected Results:**
- Existing maps listed with details
- Map quality assessment shown
- RTAB-Map resumes with existing database

### Test 4: Localization Mode
```bash
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh localization
# Select existing map
# Should start localization
```

**Expected Results:**
- Map quality check before starting
- Localization uses static layer from RTAB-Map
- Nav2 configured for map frame

### Test 5: Map Management
```bash
python3 src/tractor_bringup/tractor_bringup/map_manager.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- Interactive map management menu
- Create, list, assess, delete maps
- Quality assessment with recommendations

### Test 6: Safety System
```bash
# Launch with safety enabled (default)
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh mapping
# Create or select map
# Test with obstacles in front of robot
```

**Expected Results:**
- Safety monitor stops robot before collisions
- Emergency stop functionality works
- Velocity commands properly gated

## Configuration Validation

### RTAB-Map Parameters
- `Grid/RangeMax: "4.0"` - Reduced for indoor
- `RGBD/LinearUpdate: "0.10"` - More frequent updates
- `Kp/MaxFeatures: "1000"` - Increased for indoor textures
- `Mem/STMSize: "50"` - Increased for indoor complexity

### Nav2 Parameters
- Consistent robot radius: `0.093` in both configs
- Matching controller parameters for smooth transitions
- Standardized safety distances
- Unified costmap configurations

### Safety Parameters
- Emergency stop distance: `0.25m`
- Hard stop distance: `0.08m`
- Warning distance: `0.20m`
- Point cloud topic: `/camera/camera/depth/color/points`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not found**
   - Check /home/ubuntu/maps directory exists
   - Verify .db files are present
   - Check file permissions

2. **Safety not working**
   - Ensure RTAB-Map is publishing point cloud
   - Check transform tree is complete
   - Verify safety monitor is running

3. **Localization fails**
   - Ensure map has good quality (80%+ score)
   - Check static layer is receiving map data
   - Verify initial pose is reasonable

4. **Timing issues**
   - Allow full startup sequence (30+ seconds)
   - Check all nodes are running
   - Verify TF transforms are available

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check running nodes
ros2 node list

# Check topics
ros2 topic list

# Check transforms
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames

# Check map quality
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('src/tractor_bringup/tractor_bringup')
import rclpy
from map_manager import MapManager
rclpy.init()
manager = MapManager()
quality = manager.assess_map_quality('your_map_name')
print(quality)
manager.destroy_node()
rclpy.shutdown()
"

# Check safety status
ros2 topic echo /safety_monitor_status

# Check diagnostics
ros2 topic echo /diagnostics
```

## Performance Expectations

### Indoor Mapping Performance
- **Startup time**: ~30 seconds for full system
- **Map quality**: 80%+ for good indoor maps
- **Update rate**: 3Hz for RTAB-Map processing
- **Memory usage**: ~2GB for typical indoor environments

### Navigation Performance
- **Planning time**: <1 second for typical indoor paths
- **Control frequency**: 15Hz for smooth motion
- **Safety response**: <50ms for obstacle detection
- **Recovery behaviors**: Automatic if stuck

## Map Quality Guidelines

### Excellent Maps (80-100%)
- 200+ nodes
- Multiple loop closures
- <10% bad nodes
- Full area coverage

### Good Maps (60-79%)
- 100-200 nodes
- Some loop closures
- 10-20% bad nodes
- Good coverage with gaps

### Fair Maps (40-59%)
- 50-100 nodes
- Few or no loop closures
- 20-30% bad nodes
- Partial coverage

### Poor Maps (<40%)
- <50 nodes
- No loop closures
- >30% bad nodes
- Incomplete coverage

## Usage Examples

### Daily Mapping Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start enhanced mapper
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh mapping

# 2. Create new map for today's session
# Select 'n' -> "living_room_$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# 3. Map the environment
# Let autonomous mapper run or use teleop

# 4. Check map quality
# Use map manager to assess quality

# 5. Save and exit
# Map automatically saved to /home/ubuntu/maps/
```

### Localization Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start localization
./start_rtabmap_nav2_enhanced.sh localization

# 2. Select high-quality map
# Choose map with 80%+ quality score

# 3. Verify localization
# Check robot position in map

# 4. Navigate
# Use Nav2 goals for autonomous navigation
```
