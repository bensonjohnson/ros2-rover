## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Details

### Optimized Network Architecture

The new architecture is specifically designed for efficient inference on the RK3588 NPU:

```python
# Create optimized model
from optimized_depth_network import create_optimized_model

model = create_optimized_model(
    stacked_frames=1,
    extra_proprio=13,
    performance_mode="balanced",  # "fast", "balanced", "accurate"
    enable_temporal=False
)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy
- **Channel Attention**: Focus on important features automatically
- **Dynamic Width Multiplier**: Automatically adjust model complexity based on performance
- **NPU-Optimized Operations**: Use ReLU6 and other NPU-friendly operations

### Enhanced ES Trainer

The multi-objective ES trainer optimizes for multiple goals simultaneously:

```python
# Multi-objective weights (automatically adjusted during training)
objective_weights = {
    "exploration": 0.4,    # Encourage discovery of new areas
    "efficiency": 0.3,     # Reward effective movement
    "safety": 0.2,         # Avoid collisions and unsafe behaviors  
    "smoothness": 0.1      # Encourage realistic robot actions
}
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressively increase task complexity
- **Elite Preservation**: Maintain best-performing individuals across generations
- **Diversity Injection**: Prevent population convergence
- **Novelty Archive**: Track and encourage diverse behaviors

### Adaptive Reward System

The reward system automatically adjusts to improve learning:

```python
# Create adaptive reward calculator
from adaptive_reward_system import create_adaptive_reward_calculator

reward_calc = create_adaptive_reward_calculator(
    mode="balanced",  # "exploration", "balanced", "safety", "efficiency"
    enable_curiosity=True,
    enable_adaptive_scaling=True
)
```

**Curiosity Mechanisms:**
- **Prediction Error**: Reward actions that lead to surprising outcomes
- **Scene Complexity**: Higher rewards for navigating complex environments
- **Novelty Detection**: Encourage visiting unvisited areas
- **Behavioral Diversity**: Prevent repetitive action patterns

./start_npu_exploration_depth.sh es_hybrid \
    --use_enhanced_es true \
    --performance_mode balanced \

```

### Manual Configuration

You can also manually configure the system by editing the launch parameters:

```python
# Network architecture settings
performance_mode = "balanced"  # "fast", "balanced", "accurate"
width_multiplier = 1.0         # Model complexity (0.5-1.5)

# ES training settings  
population_size = 15           # Larger = better exploration, slower
sigma = 0.08                  # Mutation strength
learning_rate = 0.015         # Parameter update rate

# Multi-objective weights
exploration_weight = 0.4      # Novelty and area coverage
efficiency_weight = 0.3       # Speed and goal achievement
safety_weight = 0.2          # Collision avoidance
smoothness_weight = 0.1      # Realistic actions

# Reward system settings
reward_mode = "balanced"      # "exploration", "balanced", "safety", "efficiency"
enable_curiosity = True       # Curiosity-driven exploration
enable_adaptive_scaling = True # Automatic reward adjustment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Inference Latency**
   - Switch to "fast" performance mode
   - Reduce width_multiplier to 0.8
   - Disable temporal modeling

2. **Poor Exploration**
   - Increase exploration_weight to 0.5
   - Enable curiosity rewards
   - Reduce safety_weight temporarily

3. **Training Instability**
   - Reduce sigma to 0.05
   - Increase population_size to 20
   - Enable adaptive_scaling

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce population_size to 8
   - Use "fast" performance mode
   - Reduce buffer_capacity

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed debugging:

```bash
# Launch with debug mode
./start_npu_exploration_depth.sh es_hybrid \
    --debug true \
    --enable_logging true
```

This will provide detailed logs of:
- Evolution progress
- Reward calculations  
- Performance metrics
- Error conditions

## üìà Advanced Features

### Curriculum Learning

The system automatically progresses through difficulty stages:

1. **Basic Movement** (Stage 0): Learn simple forward/backward motion
2. **Obstacle Avoidance** (Stage 1): Navigate around simple obstacles  
3. **Complex Exploration** (Stage 2): Handle complex environments

Progression criteria are based on performance metrics and safety scores.

### Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization

When enabled, the system uses Bayesian optimization to automatically tune:
- Population size
- Mutation strength (sigma)
- Learning rate
- Objective weights

This runs in the background and suggests improvements every few generations.

### Hardware-Specific Optimizations

The system automatically detects and optimizes for:
- CPU core count (thread allocation)
- Available memory (buffer sizes)
- NPU availability (model quantization)
- Platform capabilities (operation selection)
